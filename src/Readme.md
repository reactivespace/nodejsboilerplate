# Express TypeScript Boilerplate

A basic boilerplate for starting an Express.js application with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template.
4. Build the project with `npm run build`.
5. Start the server with `npm run start` for production or `npm run dev` for development.

## Scripts

- `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript.
- `npm run start`: Start the server in production mode.
- `npm run dev`: Start the server with nodemon (development mode).
